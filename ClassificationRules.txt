Audiometry Classification Rules:

%%
Types of Hearing Loss: Depends upon what part of your hearing system is damaged.
Three types of hearing loss:

1. Conductive Hearing Loss
2. Sensorineural Hearing Loss
3. Mixed Hearing Loss

Note:
* AC threshold represents whole hearing loss including either or both conductive
(outer and middle ear) and sensorineural (inner ear, cochlea, and auditory nerve)
* BC threshold represents sensorineural hearing loss
* Air-Bone-Gap (ABG = AC threshold - BC threshold) represents conductive hearing
loss. Note that ABG >= 0, i.e., Theoretically, AC threshold >= BC threshold for
all test frequencies. This is because air conduction also tests outer and middle
ear in addition to the bone conduction mechanism. However, in practice, AC threshold
can be within 10 dB less than BC threshold, i.e., AC threshold >= BC threshold - 10 dB.

%%
Degree of Hearing Loss: The degree of hearing loss is defined as follows:

Calculate the average (called pure-tone average PTA) of 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz thresholds in dB 
 if -10  <= PTA <= 15  dB   => Normal Hearing
 if  15  <  PTA <= 25  dB   => Slight Hearing Loss
 if  25  <  PTA <= 40  dB   => Mild Hearing Loss
 if  40  <  PTA <= 55  dB   => Moderate Hearing Loss
 if  55  <  PTA <= 70  dB   => Moderately Severe Hearing Loss
 if  70  <  PTA <= 90  dB   => Severe Hearing Loss
 if  90  <  PTA             => Profound Hearing Loss

%%
Configuration (Shape) of Hearing Loss:
1. High-Frequency: Hearing loss in higher frequency range (4000 - 8000 Hz):
You are looking at the audiogram in the high-frequency range, i.e., the dB
values between 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz. The rest of the rules apply as it is
but to the part of the audiogram corresponding to 4000-8000 Hz.
PTA is the average of dB values in the high frequency range 4000 - 8000 Hz.

2. Low-Frequency: Hearing loss in lower frequency range (125 - 4000 Hz):
You are looking at the audiogram in the low-frequency range, i.e., the dB
values between 125 Hz and 4000 Hz. The rest of the rules apply as it is
but to the part of the audiogram corresponding to 125-4000 Hz.
PTA is the average of dB values in the low frequency range 125 - 4000 Hz.

3. Bilateral: Hearing loss in both ears (may not be of the same type)

4. Unilateral: Hearing loss in only one ear. Hearing in the other ear is
normal. Have to specify Unilateral-Left or Unilateral-Right for left and
right ears, respectively.

5. Symmetrical: Severity (degree) and shape of hearing loss are the same in
each ear. If the PTA value for the left and right ears are within 10 dB of
each other.

6. Asymmetrical: Each ear has a different severity and shape of hearing loss.
If the PTA value for the left and right ears are NOT within 10 dB of each other.


Note: In the beginning, we may only want to classify "Degree", then "Degree
and Type", and finally "Degree, Type, and Configuration" of hearing loss.
This way we can incrementally test our code.

%%
Classification of Hearing Loss:

A classification will consist of a three tuple: (Type of Hearing Loss,
Degree of Hearing Loss, Configuration of Hearing Loss)

Examples: 

(Conductive, Severe, Bilateral)
(Sensorineural, Profound, Unilateral - Left Ear)
(Mixed, Moderate, Bilateral - Low-Frequency)
(Conductive, Severe, Symmetrical)
(Sensorineural, Profound, Asymmetrical)
(Mixed, Moderate, Unilateral - Right Ear - High-Frequency)

Classification Rules for Determining the Types of Hearing Loss
(Conductive, Sensorineural, Mixed):

You have two sets of audiograms, one for air-conduction (AC) and the
second for bone-conduction (BC). AC measurements combined with BC
measurements helps differentiate outer and middle ear problems (conductive
hearing loss) from inner ear problems (sensorineural hearing loss).

%%
1.  Conductive Hearing Loss: Reduced hearing sensitivity (or hearing
loss) with AC but normal hearing sensitivity with BC.

Air Conduction pure-tone average (ACPTA)
Bone Conduction pure-tone average (BCPTA)
Air-Bone Gap (ABG) at a given frequency: The difference between the AC
and BC thresholds at a given frequency. (ABG = AC Threshold - BC Threshold).

    if (-10   <= BCPTA <= 15  dB)  AND (-10  <= ACPTA <= 15  dB) AND (ABG <= 10 dB for all frequencies)  => Normal Hearing
	if (-10   <= BCPTA <= 15  dB)  AND (-10  <= ACPTA <= 15  dB) AND (ABG >  10 dB for all frequencies)  => Normal Conductive Hearing Loss
    if (-10   <= BCPTA <= 15  dB)  AND ( 15  <  ACPTA <= 25  dB) AND (ABG >  10 dB for all frequencies)  => Slight Conductive Hearing Loss	
    if (-10   <= BCPTA <= 15  dB)  AND ( 25  <  ACPTA <= 40  dB) AND (ABG >  10 dB for all frequencies)  => Mild Conductive Hearing Loss
    if (-10   <= BCPTA <= 15  dB)  AND ( 40  <  ACPTA <= 55  dB) AND (ABG >  10 dB for all frequencies)  => Moderate Conductive Hearing Loss
    if (-10   <= BCPTA <= 15  dB)  AND ( 55  <  ACPTA <= 70  dB) AND (ABG >  10 dB for all frequencies)  => Moderately Severe Conductive Hearing Loss
    if (-10   <= BCPTA <= 15  dB)  AND ( 70  <  ACPTA <= 90  dB) AND (ABG >  10 dB for all frequencies)  => Severe Conductive Hearing Loss
    if (-10   <= BCPTA <= 15  dB)  AND ( 90  <  ACPTA          ) AND (ABG >  10 dB for all frequencies)  => Profound Conductive Hearing Loss
	
Note: To keep BCTPA within a certain specified range, you may select all
the values that comprise the BCTPA average to be within the same range.	
	
Diagnosis: The impairment is most likely due to the an obstruction
or blockage of the outer or middle ear.

Example: 

BC Audiogram measurements: 
Right Ear (250 Hz, 0 dB), (500 Hz, 0 dB), (1000 Hz, 0 dB),  (2000 Hz, 0 dB), (4000 Hz, 10 dB)
Left Ear  (250 Hz, 0 dB), (500 Hz, 0 dB), (1000 Hz, 10 dB), (2000 Hz, 0 dB), (4000 Hz, 10 dB)


AC Audiogram measurements: 
Right Ear (250 Hz, 30 dB), (500 Hz, 30 dB), (1000 Hz, 30 dB), (2000 Hz, 20 dB), (4000 Hz, 20 dB)
Left Ear  (250 Hz, 40 dB), (500 Hz, 35 dB), (1000 Hz, 30 dB), (2000 Hz, 20 dB), (4000 Hz, 20 dB)

The system should classify the above as 'Mild Conductive Hearing Loss'

%%
2.  Sensorineural Hearing Loss: When the air conduction (AC) and
bone conduction (BC) thresholds are approximately the same (within
10 dB of each other) at ALL test frequencies.

ACT_250  = air conduction threshold in dB at frequency 250 Hz
ACT_500  = air conduction threshold in dB at frequency 500 Hz
ACT_1000 = air conduction threshold in dB at frequency 1000 Hz
ACT_2000 = air conduction threshold in dB at frequency 2000 Hz
ACT_4000 = air conduction threshold in dB at frequency 4000 Hz
ACT_8000 = air conduction threshold in dB at frequency 8000 Hz

BCT_250  = bone conduction threshold in dB at frequency 250 Hz
BCT_500  = bone conduction threshold in dB at frequency 500 Hz
BCT_1000 = bone conduction threshold in dB at frequency 1000 Hz
BCT_2000 = bone conduction threshold in dB at frequency 2000 Hz
BCT_4000 = bone conduction threshold in dB at frequency 4000 Hz
BCT_8000 = bone conduction threshold in dB at frequency 8000 Hz

ABG = (ACT_X - BCT_X) <= 10 dB for all X = 250,500,1000,2000,4000,
8000: Air-Bone Gap (ABG) that is the difference between the air
conduction and bone conduction threshold is less than or equal to
10 dB for all test frequencies.

    if (15  < BCPTA <= 25  dB)  AND (15  <  ACPTA <= 25  dB)  AND (ABG <= 10 dB for all X = 250,500,1000,2000,4000,8000)   =>  Slight Sensorineural Hearing Loss	
    if (25  < BCPTA <= 40  dB)  AND (25  <  ACPTA <= 40  dB)  AND (ABG <= 10 dB for all X = 250,500,1000,2000,4000,8000)   =>  Mild Sensorineural Hearing Loss
    if (40  < BCPTA <= 55  dB)  AND (40  <  ACPTA <= 55  dB)  AND (ABG <= 10 dB for all X = 250,500,1000,2000,4000,8000)   =>  Moderate Sensorineural Hearing Loss
    if (55  < BCPTA <= 70  dB)  AND (55  <  ACPTA <= 70  dB)  AND (ABG <= 10 dB for all X = 250,500,1000,2000,4000,8000)   =>  Moderately Severe Sensorineural Hearing Loss
    if (70  < BCPTA <= 90  dB)  AND (70  <  ACPTA <= 90  dB)  AND (ABG <= 10 dB for all X = 250,500,1000,2000,4000,8000)   =>  Severe Sensorineural Hearing Loss
    if (90  < BCPTA          )  AND (90  <  ACPTA          )  AND (ABG <= 10 dB for all X = 250,500,1000,2000,4000,8000)   =>  Profound Sensorineural Hearing Loss


Note: To keep BCTPA within a certain specified range, you may select all
the values that comprise the BCTPA average to be within the same range.

%%
3. Mixed Hearing Loss: Both AC and BC thresholds are reduced in sensitivity
(show loss) but ABG(ACT_X - BCT_X) >= 10 dB for all test frequencies. This
means the hearing loss is partially conductive and partially sensorineural.

    if (15  <  BCPTA <= 25  dB)    AND   (15  <  ACPTA <= 25  dB)   AND  (ABG > 10 for all frequencies X)   => Mixed Hearing Loss (Bone Conduction Slight-Air Conduction Slight)
